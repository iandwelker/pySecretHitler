So this is going to be my plan for secret hitler

Dependencies:
	enum34
	PyInquirer

First iteration: Let's just implement the bare minimum, for keeping track of everything. So that I could like screen share this
instead of Sam having to get out his board. For this, we need:
	Card Dealing / Tracking
	Card play tracking
	Failed election tracking
	Role tracking
	If electing Hitler will end the game
	Elegibility for being elected
	Policy peeking (showing but not dealing)
	Player removal (assassination)
	Veto Power
