# Secret Hitler

This is a python version of the popular board/card game called 'Secret Hitler'. It is intended to be played on a singular computer, although a version which can be played on multiple computers is in the works.

The folder "server_version" is the in-progress version which should allow multiple people to play at the same time from different computers, but it is not complete by any means. give it some time.

## To install
 pip3 install pyInquirer
 <br/>git clone https://github.com/iandwelker/pySecretHitler
 
## To run
 cd pySecretHitler
 <br/>chmod +x ./shgui.py
 <br/>./shgui.py
